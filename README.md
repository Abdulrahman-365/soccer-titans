## Testing
Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

During development I made use of google developer tools to ensure everything was working correctly and to assist with troubleshooting when things were not working as expected.

I have gone through each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.

I have also used lighthouse to check the accessibility and performance of the site, together with W3 Validator to check the HMTL & CSS.

### Validator Testing
 - #### HTML
   - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C Markup Validator.

### Form Testing
 - The form has been tested to ensure it would not submit without the required input fields being filled in (first name, last name and mobile number).

### Links Testing
 - All navigation links were tested manually to ensure the user is directed to the correct page of the website.
 - Social Media links in the footer of each page were tested manually to ensure they direct the user to the correct page and open in a new tab. 

### Browser Testing
 - The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari browsers with no issues noted.
    
### Device Testing
 - The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 8, iPhoneX and iPad to ensure responsiveness on various screen sizes. The website performed as intended. The responsive design was also checked using Chrome developer tools across multiple devices with structural integrity holding for the various sizes.
 - I also used the following websites to test responsiveness:
     - [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fabdulrahman-365.github.io%2Fsoccer-titans%2F)
     - [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://abdulrahman-365.github.io/soccer-titans/)

### Lighthouse Reports
Lighthouse extension was downloaded and used to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

Overall, the lighthouse scores are very good for the desktop view but only the performance score for the mobile view under scoring. Only mobile view performance needs to be improved.

### Fixed Issues
 - The Facebook icon link in the footer was linking nothing when clicked, found the issue was the fav icon used as the link was not included in anchor element, so I moved it in the achor element.
 - Most of the texts were not readable due to the color choices. So, I had to use an overlay to make the texts readable.
 - The AI image chosen from Adobe firefly were blury and there sizes was above 2.5 MB, after review with mentor, I decided to change them to new small sized AI images from freepik.com.
 - The achor links were not accessible to screen readers, so had to include aria-label to improve accesiibility. This was checked with lighthouse testing and performed full score.
 - Hero message was not resposive to most of larger screens, had to make use of css flexbox and successfully managed to fix most of them.

### Pending Issues
 - Although the site is responsive to most of the screens, there are some screen sizes that are still not responsive to it such as iPad landscape with: px and etc.
